# AirSax
Visioneer project: Hold down saxophone fingerings and tenor saxophone notes play (that I recorded)
🎷
Its basically a invisible saxophone that you, can play

Hold down the saxophone fingerings and the corresponding note plays. 

You can also use your left hand thumb for the octave key, to jump up and octave

I made all the fingerings realistic, so the finger you would use to play "b" on a real saxophone is the same finger you use on the AirSax!


Supports 16 unique notes, all the way from low D to high C! Some sharps and flats (f#, g-flat) are included.
I built it entirely in python too

# History
I was originally going to make a face anyonyomizer 😀, however, since this was my first CV project I didnt realize how simple that would be. I randomly had the idea to make a saxophone while talking to @karthik

# Built with:
OpenCV, Python, Mediapipe, and the tenor sax my school gave me

 
NOTE: The current python file is optimized for streamlit. I did this because of the Visioneer rules and is not my actual project, the project is in the real.py file.
